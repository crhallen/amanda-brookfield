The Harrison family, gathering for Christmas at their big country house, inhabit
a tight safe world of privilege and tradition. But this year, time is catching
up with the elderly Pamela and John, while troubles are brewing in the lives of
their four children: Cassie, the cosseted youngest, is in the throes of a secret
affair with a married man, while awkward Elizabeth struggles with a faltering
second marriage. Peter, who will inherit Ashley House, is beginning to meet
resistance to the idea from his career-orientated wife, Helen. Only carefree
Charlie and his wife, Serena, seem truly content, with nothing to vex them but
their adolescent twin girls and the simpler teething troubles of their toddler.
But tragedy, of the most unforeseeable and devastating kind, is lying in wait.
The family, so apparently secure, is rocked to its core. Hidden turmoil, secrets
past and present, are forced to the surface, laying bare the fragility of human
happiness and the myriad faces of love in an imperfect world.
