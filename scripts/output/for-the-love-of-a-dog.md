      Dog’ is my life-affirming must-read of the year.

      Sharing Amanda and Mabel’s blossoming mutual devotion is a privilege,
      terribly addictive to read, as laughter-filled as it is honest.

After the death of her mother and the end of a new relationship leave her
heartbroken, novelist Amanda Brookfield finds her oncesecure world imploding. As
despair deepens, she latches onto theidea of getting a puppy just to revive her
optimistic spirit.

Aware that her lifestyle will not suit becoming a dog-ownerand warned by friends
not to give up her freedom, Amanda nonetheless cannot resist Mabel, an eight
week old golden doodle. Arming herself with an arsenal of equipment, she soon
learns that there are no short-cuts to training and caring for a dog. In the
daily challenges that ensue, the constant ups and downs, Amanda realises she is
starting to come to terms with her bereavement and the prospect of facing the
rest of her life alone.

<em>For The Love of a Dog</em> charts the bigger, more poignant story about the
labour of emotional recovery after the trauma of loss. Mabel shines like a light
throughout, the innocent architect of rebuilding her owner’s shattered
self-belief. Mabel’s own journey is equally captivating, as she blossoms into a
mischievous, endearing head-turner of a companion – as affectionate as she is
glorious.
