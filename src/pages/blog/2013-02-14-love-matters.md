Every so often (not just on Valentines Day) I am struck, all over again, by the
astonishing reach and drive of human love.  The Technological Revolution, Wars,
Famines, Rockets On The Moon and Melting Ice-Cap... his non-stop backdrop of
epic, game-changing events continues, often at breakneck speed, changing our
world.  And yet it is still the abstraction we call Love that beams mostly
fiercely in our daily lives, the thing most of us seek to experience and
understand.  It brings down Generals, Politicians, smitten teachers, smitten
teenagers, and everything in between.  It is the engine of all that is saintly
and selfless, as well as much that is satanic and selfish.  I know I sound
dramatic, but it is dramatic.  The endless human quest to love and be loved in
return. It trips us up but is also what keeps us going.
