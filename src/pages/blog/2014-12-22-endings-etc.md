A good ending is the hardest thing for a writer to pull off.  Readers can be
swept along by fabulous narratives, full of twist and turn, but it is the final
chapter  - the lingering taste in the mouth - against which a story will
ultimately be judged. And rightly so.  It is the point where things come
together - make sense - or fall apart.  A bad ending exposes the author as a
fraud.  A good ending makes her/him seem like a magician.  A bad ending feels
contrived, shallow, forgettable.  A good one manages unexpectedness, while,
crucially, remaining true to all that has gone before. Its characters exit the
stage, yet we feel as if they live on.

For me, this is why satisfaction with even the most ingenious seasonal TV
series - Homeland et al - starts to pall.  There is never a proper 'ending'.
 Instead, we are led a merry dance, teased, manipulated, towards yet another
supposedly grand finale that is no more than a teeing up for the next year's
serving of more-of-the-same.  It is like eating a bag of sweets - more-ish but
ultimately un-satiating.  If a plot is endless then................... why
should we care about it?

Real life, of course, offers few neat conclusions, teed up or otherwise.  We
strive, we reach for things, and are constantly  blown off course.  Sometimes in
small ways (cancelled trains, twisted ankles, lost passports), sometimes in vast
ways (violence, love, illness).  And when it comes to our own endings (dignitas
and suicide aside) we have least control of all, a powerlessness mirrored only
by the unlookedfor matter of actually being born.  Birth, Death, they just
happen.

And if I am honest, which, with age, I try increasingly to be, I am sure that
some of the appeal of writing fiction is simply because it offers some sort of
counterbalance to this uncertainty.  My novels may not be 'real life', but at
least I am in charge. Endings may be fiendish to get right.  Characters may
rebel, storming off down paths one had not envisaged and hurling out unexpected
words.  But at least, when the chips are down, I retain the glorious power to
rein them in, sort them out, brush them down and nudge them towards their
destinies.
