On November 1st my new book, _For The Love of a Dog_, will be officially
launched into the world. I shall have a party, open some fizz, say a few words.
Milestones must me marked or they slip through our fingers like time.

I like the word 'launch'. It is used to describe the promotion of anything these
days, but for me it always summons the image of a ship, heaving into the sea
after the pop and smash of champagne bottles, embarking on its very first
journey alone, a bulk receding to a dot on the sky-line.

Books, like ships, take a lot of work before such a point can be reached.
There's all the outer, structural stuff - the building materials, the production
line, the forward planning. Publishers want products that are top quality,
eye-catching and with the resilience to thrive. More vital still, is the toil
and sweat behind the scenes, the writing, the crafting, the honing, all to
ensure that the myriad component parts run as smoothly as they can. Invisibility
of effort is the key. It is what takes most of the toil and sweat, often over
years. Each creation is a combined product of learned knowledge and the pushing
of new ideas. It requires trial and error, the willingness to fail. Endless
patience. A lot of blind faith.

And sometimes, secretly, you love this toil too much to want to let it go. It
takes a certain courage to admit the time for launch has arrived. Because,
although you have tried your very hardest to create something that is the best
version of itself, the world is wide, often cruel or indifferent, and nothing is
sure. Oceans toss or cradle their occupants according to whim and weather. Your
book might sink. Or maybe it will bob along, riding choppy waves like a doughty
duck.

The main thing is to let it go. Dust off your palms. Shift your focus to a new
horizon. That thing you made, with all its merits and failings, has started on
its own journey. It is no longer yours.
