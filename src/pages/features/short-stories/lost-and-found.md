LOST AND FOUND

“So…um…pull together and all will be well.” The Master paused. Six months in and he was still finding his feet. He seemed to reach for his wine glass. Diners of all common rooms held their collective breath in the hope of a final toast; but the fingers fluttered back into the folds of his gown and the speech lurched on. 

Lawrence let his gaze travel round the hall’s familiar gallery of past Heads of House, seeing nothing but his own emptiness in the framed array of dry, posed expressions. The Master’s words hummed in and out of focus like a faulty radio; the college was a ship, the students its sailors, docking into ports near and far. Lawrence could feel a yawn threatening, tugging at the corners of his mouth. He fought it hard, feigning a frown of concentration as his eyes watered. Someone might notice his distraction and that wouldn't do. Since Marjorie they all watched him so, and he hated it.

Forty five years before, as a Junior Research Fellow new to High Table, he had never felt so painfully self-conscious. Shy yes, but never wary. The Master in those days had been a retired diplomat, but also, at heart, a musician. A mad musician. There had been wild parties in the Fellows’ Garden involving entire orchestras, and talk of smaller, even wilder ones inside the lodgings. It had not been ideal of course – the cellars were reputed to have suffered badly and some of the gossip had been detrimental to the college’s academic standing – but at least there had been some vibrancy about the place, Lawrence reflected bleakly, some laughter, some charm, some *hope*.

The hall came back into focus. The current incumbent had become a man trapped in a maze of his own making. Hesitation. Repetition. Deviation. All three celebrated crimes were in full swing as he now groped through the fog of his own syntax for a meaningful exit from the speech. By the time he succeeded a huddle of students were visibly suppressing sniggers, among them a third year of Lawrence’s, Harry Langham. They looked rather drunk, Lawrence noted, gloomily pondering how, for girls and boys alike, excessive alcohol consumption seemed to have assumed the guise of a hobby, pursued for its own sake, rather than as an adjunct to other pleasures.

Filing out to the SCR for coffee, Lawrence was aware of his gloom gathering momentum, as it seemed to so easily these days, a storm always ready to break. He kept his stride steady and his head high. It was just a question of holding on, he told himself. Holding out. It was eighth week of Trinity. In a few days there would be the final trip to the chalet to get through; an ordeal, but he would manage, somehow. After that it was just a question of packing up, making sure his replacement knew all he needed, and retreating. Retirement would at least mean privacy, even if it offered scant prospect of peace.

Lawrence pedalled slowly, following the thin beam of his bike light. He hadn’t wanted to be in the dinner, or in the SCR, but now he didn’t want to get home either. The house would be so dark, so empty. And yet not to want to be anywhere seemed pitiful too.

He let himself in quickly, and took the stairs two at a time, telling himself to get a grip. In the doorway of the bedroom however, he froze. Books and clothes lay strewn round the open mouth of his suitcase like the aftermath of a small explosion. He had spent the afternoon picking things up and putting them down again, getting nowhere. Binoculars. Vests. Pyjamas. Socks. A bobble hat. That grief robbed one of the power to think straight had been one of the many grisly discoveries of recent months. He couldn’t prioritise, or make decisions, about even the most trivial things. Only at his desk, immersed in the familiar comforting industry of research, did some kind of sustained ability to focus return. 

Uppermost on the pile of scattered garments was a favourite grey jumper, one Marjorie had knitted. Once soft and loose, the cables had shrunk into matted clumps, sorry testimony to his ineptitude with the washing machine. Lawrence picked the garment up and pressed it to his face, seeking traces of his wife in its woolly scent. *What the imagination seizes as beauty...* An image scythed through his train of thought, of Marjorie the previous year, knitting at great speed, an eye on the clock because of dinner, one ear tuned to the Brahms on their old CD player, the other tuned to him. He had mislaid a journal and she pointed it out at once, in a pile by his armchair, using one of her knitting needles, her grey eyes twinkling fondly over the rim of her half-moon spectacles, her thick soft hair falling about her face. ‘You’d be lost without me,’ she had scolded. And Lawrence had laughed, agreeing, never imagining that it would be so soon.

In bed at last, he was too tired even to read. But the moment he closed his eyes all sleepiness evaporated. His brain fizzed with apprehension instead, about the trip. He had tried to pull out but the Master had insisted, declaring that, after two decades as the reputed life and soul of the chalet tradition, it was only right that he should lead one final troupe of students to discover the glories and benefits the place provided. That Lawrence had ceased to care about the glories or benefits of anything, let alone a dilapidated property in the French Alps, had felt like a sordid secret; one that he feared would soon surely show, as ugly and undeniable as the bulge on poor Marjorie’s shaven head that had finally made the doctors say there could be no more operating.

The only shameful solace the trip offered was the chance for some respite from the now constant hazard of being grilled by his successor, a lithe square-jawed American with degrees from Harvard and Princeton, who was already living in Oxford and eager to drain Lawrence of every last piece of information about life in college and the university in general. The man boasted a string of acclaimed publications to his name, mostly on specialist aspects of literature that Lawrence had spent a life-time dodging or disdaining: *Deconstruction. Post-modernism. Neo-Feminism.* Energetic, personable and with a formidable CV, the man had easily been the most outstanding candidate for the job; not an old-school specialist on the Romantics, like Lawrence, but an established, universally recognised expert on the modern novel. He had even written a novel, to stunning critical acclaim, called ‘Cordelia’s Secret’. *“An ingeniously twisted, imaginative tale involving the emotional blindness of a curmudgeonly, grieving old man* ….” Lawrence had read the reviews but not the book, a fact which was starting to be remarked upon. He was saving it for his retirement, he joked, lying as he seemed to about so many things these days, glibly and bitterly. Towards the American he felt a sort of loathing that was no less visceral for the fact of knowing it to be unreasonable. Life moved on. The new became the old. It was only his own failings that made it feel like such a drama.

At Lyons airport, wrenching his case off the conveyor belt, Lawrence felt his back go. It was never a major event. Just a small one, sometimes with major consequences. He shuffled to the toilet and rummaged in his carry-on bag for some of his tablets, the prescription ones he kept for emergencies. Filling in forms for the rental of the minibus, he paid extra so that the two third years, Harry Langham and Claire Pearson were eligible to drive. He sat in the front seat, barking out directions, gripping the door handle until the pills had done their work and the drilling pain in his lower back started to ease. There were only seven students this year, the smallest group he had ever taken. Twelve had signed up, but then over half had dropped out as the date approached. At one point Lawrence had high hopes the trip might be scrapped altogether. From six girls they were down to two, Claire, who was a no-frills classicist from Manchester Grammar, and Lizzie a twitchy rake-thin second year historian with a fierce intellect but an even fiercer passion for acting; from early prospects of a First, she was, thanks to her thespian distractions, now reputed to be looking down the barrel of a poor Second. The boys comprised his two, Harry and a shy, promisingly intense fresher called Ivan, and three others, one reading PPE, a geographer and a biochemist.

‘So if it’s not a ski resort, what do we do at this place exactly?’ yelped Lizzie, squeezing Harry’s shoulder as he swung the van round a particularly sharp bend on the climb through the mountains.

‘Read, eat, sleep, isn’t that right, Prof?’

Prof? For a moment Lawrence was tempted to punch the boy in the middle of his wide handsome face. When had that slipped into his impudent third year student’s lexicon? Instead he cast a look of world-weary non-chalance round the van. ‘We might discuss the occasional subject, I suppose. You know, test those shrivelled little brains of yours. The point about the chalet is it is up to you. I am merely…there.’ He returned his attention to the view, seeing not the steepening crags, the thickening whiteness crusting their edges, but a merged memory of previous chalet trips – the discussion subjects he had prepared, picking out themes that he thought might stimulate fresh, half-formed minds; newspapers, philosophies, biographies – everything had been potential material once upon a time. And then there had been the mapping of new walks to try, new views to find, new local produce to taste, wine included. ‘Losing you again, am I,’ Marjorie would tease fondly, helping him pack, never making a big deal of the fact of being left alone, the spare bedrooms they had once hoped to fill gathering dust as the fertility treatments failed and their ages caught up with them.

The mountains seemed to grow organically, surfacing out of the low cloud like foaming breakers in a sea. For the last few miles they were ambushed by a sudden curtain of fog. The air in the van grew perceptibly chillier. Harry fought with the heating dial, finding the radio in the process. A tinny pop song pounded out and the students all joined in, slapping their thighs, roaring the words. Lawrence hunched deeper inside his coat, telling himself not to say something acerbic, not to mind, not to *feel.*

The fog followed them up the track into the village, thickening at every turn. By the time they reached the chalet, having stopped for supplies in the back-room of a shack that passed for a local shop, visibility was so hazardous that Lawrence clambered out to guide Harry the final few yards into the drive, thumping the bonnet of the van when he got too close to the fence or the ditch-edge on the other side.

The chalet was in its usual faintly Spartan, but impeccable state – thin rugs on bare wooden floors, plain square furniture, a few prints on the walls, one single and six double bunk bedrooms, two bathrooms, cold enough to discourage dithering, and a spacious kitchen-sitting area that housed a wood-burning stove set between two long windows designed to show off the spectacular alpine views. For now, both were flecked, dense grey panels, as blank as dysfunctional television screens.

At supper Lawrence drank a little too much. Four glasses instead of his usual two. It took the edge off both the dull hammering in his lower spine and the meat stew, which had smelt delicious while Harry and Lizzie were cooking it, but which had proved hard on the teeth. Cooking wasn’t his thing or he might have been able to offer advice. Marjorie had been the cook. Marjorie had been everything.

The dinner conversation centred round skiing. Between them the students seemed to know most of the major resorts in Europe, while the Geographer had also skied in Vermont and the Biochemist in Aspen. This ensured a heated debate on the relative merits of conditions and amenities between the two continents. Afterwards Claire and the Geographer washed up while the rest lounged with more wine, picking at a hunk of the local goats cheese and dividing their time between packs of playing cards and an assortment of smartphones and laptops.

‘There are books, you know,’ Lawrence snarled, having announced that he was on his way to bed. He hadn’t meant to snarl. He hadn’t meant to speak. He gestured at the shelves on either side of the sitting room doorway, packed with reading matter left by previous generations of visitors. ‘They contain….*ideas….*that sort of thing.’

‘We like books, Prof,’ said Harry, cheeky as usual. ‘I’m reading one here.’ He tapped the machine on his lap.

‘But it’s nice to take a break,’ put in Lizzie, exchanging a tipsy, insolent eye-roll with the Biochemist. ‘Let our boffin-brains rest.’

‘Indeed.’ Lawrence was no longer listening. He had plucked a book off the shelf, one he cared about especially. ‘This was written by an ex-student of mine. He got a play into the West End once too, about quantum mechanics mirroring the randomness of human life.’ He shoved the book back into its slot. ‘But there we go. Ancient history. Goodnight.’

He heard the swell of their chatter as he closed the door, felt their relief. He cleaned his teeth viciously, sawing at his gums, and then threw two more pain-killers down his throat. It was up to him to make the chalet work. He knew because he had done it scores of times. He knew it but he couldn’t do it, not this year. He was empty. No batteries. No reserves. A husk. A fraud. The sooner retirement swallowed him up the better for everyone. Lawrence yanked at the curtains which refused to close. The black minivan, just a few yards away, was smothered, a grey smudge. Maybe the fog was going to stay the entire week. What fun that would be.

In bed he couldn’t concentrate enough to read. Mounting strains of merriment came from down the corridor. They would have opened another bottle, or two, Lawrence reflected darkly. That’s what they all did. Not that drinking didn’t form a part of chalet life – at times an essential part – but it had always grown out of an occasion rather than dictating it. There were shrieks. Lizzie. A silly flirt of a girl, exactly the sort to throw away her academic talent in pursuit of glory in front of an audience. Yes, he could see it now, she would strut and fret her hour upon a stage upon a stage upon a stage….

It took Lawrence a few moments to realise he was being shaken awake. He sat up, groggy, aware of two daggers of pain stabbing down through his lower back and into his buttocks. It was the sensible girl, Claire, but not making much sense, gabbling about someone being missing.

‘Slower. Start again.’ Lawrence swigged from the tooth-mug of water on his bedside table. Through the gap in his curtains it was obvious that the grey gauze of dawn had so far done nothing to shift the fog. ‘What do you mean, missing? Who is missing?’

‘Harry. We’ve only just realised. He was supposed to share with Ivan, but Ivan went to bed first and it looks like Harry never joined him. I’m with Lizzie, who also came in late, but says she fell asleep on the sofa. I guess we all sort of crashed out. And it was only because Ivan went to the toilet, and saw Harry wasn’t there – or anywhere – that he realised, and we’ve called outside, but it’s impossible to see a thing and we’re wondering if we should phone the police or something, but….’

Lawrence was pulling his clothes on over his pyjamas, his back pinging with every tug. He snatched extra garments from his still open, unpacked case, his thermal vest, an extra shirt, the grey jumper and then his old fleece on top of that. He put on the bobble hat last, checking the pockets of his coat for his gloves, wondering if he looked as hopeless as he felt.

‘Was he drunk?’

‘Drunk? No, I….’ The girl looked uncertain.

In the doorway behind her Ivan had appeared. ‘None of us were drunk,’ he said stoutly.

Claire started to cry.

‘He’s fine, I’m sure,’ Lawrence said briskly, indicating with a stern look to Ivan that some comfort was called for. The boy obeyed at once, putting an arm round Claire’s shoulders. ‘He probably went out for a breather and lost his bearings,’ Lawrence went on. ‘Easily done. Now then, give me one of your phones – because mine’s dead,’ he snapped, when Ivan looked puzzled. ‘If I don’t call in say, forty minutes, I want you to ring the number on the wall next to the fridge, the one with ‘Emergency Mountain Rescue’ written in red above it. Okay?’

‘But one of us should come with you,’ said Ivan.

‘No you shouldn’t. I know this place and you don’t. Now show me your password on this thing so I can stay in touch.’

Outside the cold closed round him like an icy cloak. Being in the whiteness was disorientating to the point of dizziness. Lawrence stumbled round the immediate perimeter of the chalet first, calling Harry’s name as he checked the wood-pile stacks, the sparse patches of shrubbery and the lean-to responsible for housing snow shovels and other garden paraphernalia. Through the windows he caught glimpses of the students, hugging each other, checking their screens, their faces taut with worry.

Lawrence sensed the sky lightening behind the wall of cloud. If anything it seemed to make the fog denser. He had to grope his way to the van, his free hand sweeping for obstacles and balance, the chalet torch reflecting back at him uselessly. In the process it occurred to him that this was how he had been living anyway. Blindly. For months. Lost and stumbling. With no sense of direction. Behind him, the chalet glowed like a lighthouse in a storm. Lawrence ached to retreat to it, but a voice barked inside his head: *Seek and ye shall find* – not an instruction so much as an admonition, one of Marjorie’s favourites when she found something he claimed to have lost. His wallet. His glasses. His beloved fountain pen. She had been the finder. Until she herself was lost.

Oh God. Lawrence launched off down the track, sliding his feet in the manner of an inept cross-country skier, feeling for solid ground. *Not* looking would be worse, he consoled himself. And looking didn’t mean he really had to try or get his hopes up. It was just a question of going through the motions. Yes, that was what he was doing, Lawrence decided, gathering a bit of pace, he was *going through the motions*, for everyone’s sake, most of all his own. Harry was either okay or not okay. When the sun burned through the cloud they would find out soon enough. The locals were used to such incidents. Walkers, climbers, skiers, went AWOL all the time. Foreign young idiots mostly. Like Harry. Plunging out into arctic conditions without sufficient preparation or foresight.

He was walking more quickly, Lawrence realised, helped by the beat of his thoughts. The pain in his back was still present but definitely loosening. He was also starting to see through the whitened air, making out shapes of trees, the faint edge of the road. Even the torch beam seemed to be pointing forwards rather than bouncing back him. Whether this was because the fog was thinning or because his eyes were growing accustomed to it, Lawrence couldn’t tell. But it no longer felt as if he was going through the motions. Instead he was aware of really looking. Really trying. Working up quite a sweat, in fact. Something else was kicking in too: a tendril of instinct, a dim sixth sense. Which was perhaps why, having reached the outskirts of the village, he found himself cutting left, down a steeper, more broken footpath leading to a substantial plateau of land that was a favourite picnic spot on account of its panoramic views; like arriving at the edge of the world, as one awestruck student had once remarked.

Even before he saw the boy Lawrence had the oddest feeling that he was going to. He was lying on his stomach, a few yards from the precipitous drop that made the plateau so famous. He had his head on one side, facing away from Lawrence towards the breath-taking necklace of mountains, strung out like giant dancers, mitre-capped, in big skirts. In the microsecond it took to register the scene Lawrence realised he had stepped through the outer wall of the cloud-fog into a clear, beautiful, ordinary morning.

He ran towards Harry, fearing the worst. It seemed obvious – entirely in keeping with his recent lack of luck – that the boy should have expired. But Harry wasn’t dead. He started mumbling as soon as Lawrence reached him. ‘I don’t want to go back. I won’t go back.’

‘Steady now.’ Lawrence knelt down, patting the boy’s back. ‘Are you injured or just cold? You look in one piece. Are you in one piece? Can we get you sitting up? Give me your arm.’ It was like trying to move a corpse, not that Lawrence had any experience of moving a corpse. The hospice had dealt with all that, what little there had been left of Marjorie to deal with. Lawrence had held on until the last moment, gripping her shrunken twiggy hand, a drowning man clinging to a reed.

Harry stayed on the ground, stiff and uncooperative. He was wearing a fleece, but no hat or gloves. ‘I was sorry about your wife, Prof,’ he muttered. ‘We all were.’ He had started to shiver visibly. His teeth clacked round the words. ‘Lying here, I thought about her. I thought, if I die, maybe I’ll see the Prof’s wife.’

‘Of course you’re not going to die. But you’ve got to move Harry. Come on, this isn’t a joke. You’re frozen.’

‘I don’t mind. I’ve been hoping I’d die.’

‘Don’t be absurd. Why would you say such a thing?’

‘Because I love her,’ Harry blurted, ignoring Lawrence’s continued wrestling efforts to get him upright. ‘Lizzie. I love her. But she doesn’t love me.’ His voice was clear and strong suddenly, his teeth still. ‘She told me straight last night. There’s no hope, she said. No hope.’

Lawrence took off his own coat and shook it in Harry’s face. ‘Sit up, for god’s sake, so I can get this on you. Unless you’re hurt. Are you hurt?’

Harry shuffled upright. He looked dazed. ‘Of course I am hurt, sir,’ he growled. ‘Here.’ He swung a fist at his chest.

‘Don’t call me Sir.’

‘I don’t want to live. Without Lizzie, I don’t want to live.’

Having managed to zip the coat up, Lawrence slumped down next to him. He knew he must do more – get the boy to his feet, make him walk - but he needed a breather first. And Harry wasn’t going to die. He was young and strong, and unhappy. In front of them the sun had illuminated the mountain-scape to its full glory. Impossible beauty, Lawrence thought, his eyes tearing from the glare. The high snows glistened, bejewelled white satin canopies. Beneath them the rocks plunged in granite cascades, treacherous, tremendous.

‘Oh God, but I should ring them at the chalet.’ Lawrence fumbled through the pockets of the coat, Harry watching mutely, but Ivan’s phone had somehow disappeared. A faint humming sounded started in the distance overhead. ‘Oh Lord.’ Lawrence clambered to his feet, using his hand as a visor against the eye-aching blue sky. A speck was emerging out of it, a speck that was clearly a helicopter. ‘I fear that might be out looking for you.’

‘Really?’ For a moment Harry seemed impressed. But then his handsome face crumpled. ‘Lying out here, I thought about Keats a lot too. That Vale of Soul-making business.’

‘Ah, yes, that business.’ Lawrence wanted badly, to quote the letter, written by Keats to his elder brother George, but managed to resist. Harry was reviving, in all senses, and he didn’t want to jeopardise that. ‘Keats was good at making sense of things,’ he said instead, ‘almost as if he had prescient inkling of his own premature demise.’

They both fell silent. The helicopter had started a loop left. ‘We’ll miss you when you’re gone, Prof. Sometimes I’m not sure you realise that.’

‘I assume you are referring to my imminent departure from the English faculty rather than any longer term eradication?’ Lawrence sparred, knowing it would help Harry perk up, but also increasingly anxious about the helicopter, which had turned towards them again. He started to wave at it with thumbs up signs, hoping to encourage a return to base; but then Harry chose the moment to attempt to stand up only to collapse back onto the ground with a howl of pain.

‘Looks like I have hurt myself….Jeez…my ankle…it’s twisted…or something. I tripped over last night, but didn’t realise.’ He gawped at the offending limb, looking appalled, but also much more like his usual self.

‘Lucky then that your friends do indeed appear to have summoned Air Rescue. No, don’t move. They’ll have a stretcher or something.’ Lawrence stood up, briefly ruffling Harry’s unruly hair. ‘You’ll be all right.’ Relief was flooding through him, thawing him. ‘Be quite something to watch it land here, eh?’

‘Yeah, I guess.’ Harry was looking dazed.

‘Thanks for what you said just now,’ Lawrence went on levelly, ‘to know I shall be missed by Harry Langham, well that’s quite an honour. And as for the other matter you mentioned…Lizzie.’ He sighed, getting a flashback to the girl who had broken his heart before Marjorie, and thank god. ‘Trust me, the pain will pass. You are young enough to find someone else to love. Just be warned, it can arrive at the most unlikely times and in the most unexpected of places.’ He chuckled, thinking again of Marjorie and things he would never share with another soul.

The helicopter was growing noisier, a swelling silhouette against the brightening expanse of sky. Lawrence couldn’t help being glad that Harry had sustained an injury that warranted the drama of such a rescue. He was gladder still of the other rescue that had taken place, invisible though no less dramatic, inside his own heart. It would take time of course, but he knew that something inside him had shifted, something momentous. Everyone suffered, that was the thing he had been in danger of forgetting. Young, old, no one else’s inner life was ever less complicated or less vulnerable than one’s own. Such knowledge was no cure for unhappiness, but it was consolation of sorts, as good a reason as beauty for wanting to go on.
