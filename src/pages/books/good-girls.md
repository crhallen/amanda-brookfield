      The depth - the beauty - of this evocative story is almost too difficult to encapsulate.  Simply put, this book is superb.

      I adored this book; it’s sad, it’s thought provoking and ultimately very uplifting. A lovely read that I recommend highly.

For publication in October 2019, 'Good Girls' tells the compelling story of the Keating sisters: Kat is mesmerising, beautiful, smart and charming - everything a good girl should be. Her elder sister Eleanor, on the other hand, is on the awkward side of tall, clever enough to be bullied, and full of the responsibilities only an older sibling can understand. She adores her little sister but grows up certain that she can never compete with her.

The story follows the girls through a childhood dark with adult secrets and sibling tensions, and on into adulthood with all its complexities and misunderstandings. Until a terrible truth brings the sisters crashing together and finally Eleanor begins to uncover just how good Kat really was.
