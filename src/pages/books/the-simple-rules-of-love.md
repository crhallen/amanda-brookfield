      If Joanna Trollope is the queen of the Aga Saga, then Amanda Brookfield must be a strong contender for princess.

      Fabulous! This was a warm and perceptive insight into the unpredictable ways of family life. I found it both humourous and poignant. I am from a large close-knit family and could certainly relate to the frequent domestic chaos but great support network. Reading this has inspired me to seek out further novels by Amanda.

      Once into the plot I couldnt put it down. Amanda has such an insight into family relationships and life in general. I feel lost now that the book is finished. Im missing the Harrison family and Ashley House very much! Thank you so much for such a wonderful read, Amanda!

      Simply the best follow up book I have ever read, another huge slice of Harrison family life that was such compulsive reading in the first book, a complex mixture of every emotion is portrayed in a book that is almost impossible to put down, a brilliant and compelling read, nothing comes close.

The Simple Rules of Love is a multi-generational story of love, lies and family ties. The Harrisons, a close-knit, affluent clan who gather regularly at Ashley House, their beautiful old family home, are looking forward to 42-year-old Cassieâ€™s long awaited wedding and an exotic family holiday. But all such celebrations threaten to subside into chaos when an unwanted pregnancy, adultery and shadows of past losses stretch sibling and marital bonds to breaking point.
