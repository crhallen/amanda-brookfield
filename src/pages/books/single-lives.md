      Witty and Engaging

Thirty-three-year-old newspaper columnist, Annie Jordan, thinks that the only thing missing from her life is romance. Her glamorous friends, flatmate Marina and gay easy-going Jake, seem to be suffering from the same problem, in spite of far more promising social lives. Yet love, when it comes, brings as many problems as it solves. As her life starts to unravel, Annie finds it increasingly difficult to keep her darkening state of mind separate from her newspaper column and fears that she may lose her job. Illness and the confusing secretive behaviour of a new neighbour compound her difficulties, but also compel her to realise that she has no hope of finding lasting happiness with another person until she has begun to understand herself.
