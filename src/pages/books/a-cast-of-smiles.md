      What is refreshing here is the author's conspicuous sanity and her sharp line in defence of reason… It could be sentimental, but it isn’t.

A group of young professional friends, with the world at their feet, gather for the glittering wedding of Julian and Veronica. Yet behind their façade of jollity old passions and resentments are stirring. Gloria is tiring of the endless pursuit of lovers, Katherine is tormented by her unrequited feelings for Julian, while George longs to be accepted properly by his friends instead of the butt of their jokes. As the knots of emotional dishonesty tighten, tragedy brews, promising to change all their lives forever.
