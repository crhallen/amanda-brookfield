After the death of her mother and the end of a new relationship leave her heartbroken, novelist Amanda Brookfield finds her once secure world imploding. As despair deepens, she latches onto the idea of getting a puppy just to revive her optimistic spirit. 



Aware that her lifestyle will not suit becoming a dog-owner and warned by friends not to give up her freedom, Amanda nonetheless cannot resist Mabel, an eight week old golden doodle. Arming herself with an arsenal of equipment, she soon learns that there are no short-cuts to training and caring for a dog. In the daily challenges that ensue, the constant ups and downs, Amanda realises she is starting to come to terms with her bereavement and the prospect of facing the rest of her life alone. 



For The Love of a Dog charts the bigger, more poignant story about the labour of emotional recovery after the trauma of loss. Mabel shines like a light throughout, the innocent architect of rebuilding her owner’s shattered self-belief. Mabel’s own journey is equally captivating, as she blossoms into a mischievous, endearing head-turner of a companion – as affectionate as she is glorious.
