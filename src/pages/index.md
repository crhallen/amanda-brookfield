  title: A novel, 'Good Girls'
  text: Good Girls is about the Keating sisters, Kat and Eleanor, and the turns their lives take after a childhood fraught with difficulties and adolescent rivalries.  It is a coming-of-age story, a mystery and a tear-jerker. But most of all it’s a reminder of whom to keep close and whom to trust with your darkest secrets.
