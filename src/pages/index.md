    Good Girls is about the Keating sisters, Kat and Eleanor, and the turns
    their lives take after a childhood fraught with difficulties and adolescent
    rivalries.  It is a coming-of-age story, a mystery and a tear-jerker. But

    your darkest secrets.

      desolation closed in. Talk of getting a puppy was just to cheer myself up.

      of looking after myself, let alone a dog…
